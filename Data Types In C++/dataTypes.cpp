/*
    In any programming language, we have some special
    data types to tell the computer memory regarding
    what type of data we store in a specific variable in
    the memory.

    C++ supports 3 different data types to store different
    data in the computer memory.

    1) Primitive data type or Built-in data type or Fundamental data types
    2) Derived data types
    3) User-defined data types.

*/

/*

********** Primitive Data Types **********

    These are the built-in or pre-defined data types provided
    by the C++ programming language. Following are the different types
    of it:

    . Integer
    . Character
    . Boolean
    . Floating Point
    . Double Floating Point
    . Valueless or Void
    . Wide character

*/

/*

********** Derived Data Types **********

    These are the data types that are created or derived from fundamental
    data types. These are formed by combining other data types in various
    ways, such as arrays, structures, unions, enums, classes, and pointers.

    . Function
    . Array
    . Pointer
    . Reference

*/

/*

********** User-defined Data Types **********

    Based on programmer needs, these data types create by combining fundamental
    or derived data types provided by the language.

    In C++ user-defined data types mainly includes:

    . Structures
    . Classes
    . Enums
    . Unions
    . Typedefs
